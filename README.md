# IntApp2020
This is a repo for a ntua ece project on "Internet &amp; Applications"
In this project I will create a database with data about team and player stats from the premier league for the seasons 2006-2007 to 2017-2018. I will create a back end server in order to get the data from this database and an api to get the data to my javascript front end.
