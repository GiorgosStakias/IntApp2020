This is a repo for a ntua ece project on "Internet & Applications"

In this project I will use Java frameworks (Spring) to create a back end server that will have access to a MySQL database that I will create using data about the Premier League stats from season 2006-2007 to season 2017-2018. I will also use Javascript and React to create a web front end in order to be able to make queries to the back end server and demonstrate the data returned by the back end server in a user friendly way. The users will be able to pose queries related to both team and player stats (e.g. goals scored per game, team with most goals, team with most victories, top scorer, top assist maker etc).
